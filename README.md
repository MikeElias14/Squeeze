# Squeeze

This is an IOT Arduino / python project where the Arduino sends a combination of buttons to the python server via wifi. The server then sends specific keystrokes to
a musical typing keyboard to play the notes indicated by the Arduino circuit.

Currently, the server / client roles are reversed because of time constraints for this prject.
